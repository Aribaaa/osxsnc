This repository contains code to build a shim SNC adapter that
bridges between the SAP-expected ABI (with default alignment) and
the 16-bit aligned GSS-API libraries which are common on OS X.

Build the library with:
cc sncgss.c -c -Wall
cc -dynamiclib -o sncgss.dyld sncgss.o  -dynamic -Wl,-search_paths_first -framework GSS
